Selection :
Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of
the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.

In the Bubble Sort algorithm:
-> Traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at the right side. 
->In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
->This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.

Insertion sort:
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similarly to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. 
The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed in the correct position in the sorted part.

Merge sort:
Merge sort is defined as a sorting algorithm that works by dividing an array into smaller subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back
together to form the final sorted array.

QuickSort:
QuickSort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by 
placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array.
